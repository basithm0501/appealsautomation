An example of this would be a spring concert or a finals prep event. Series Program - A Series Program is an on-campus event that takes place more than once and up to seven times. These events have either the same or very similar missions and are connected in some way. Examples of Series Programs are speaker series,a weekly programming class,or a week-long cultural event. General organization meetings do not count as series programs - please apply for overhead funding for costs related to organization meetings.Trip: Conference or Team Competition - A Trip that is a Conference or Competition is an off-campus event that has a competitive nature or is a conference. Some examples are national dance competitions,regional medical conferences,debate competitions,or business conferences. Groups should not submit more than one national conference or competition in this budget request. Additional national trips will be consdered only in appeals process.Trip: NOT a Conference or Team Competition - A Non-Conference or Competition trip is any off-campusevent that does not classify as a competition or conference. This could be any kind of trip such as a trip to The Museum of Natural History,community service trips,or a visit to The White House. Series Trip: Conference or Team Competition - This would be an event that qualifies as a stand alone trip that is a Conference or Team Competition but occurs more than once and at most six times. For example,a series of three conferences that occur in three consecutive weeks or a national gaming tournament that occurs throughout the semester at different locations. NOTE: National Trips that are outside of the Tri-State Area can only be requested as a Singular Trip and not a Series. You may appeal for another National Trip if needed through the allocations appeals process each semester.Series Trip: NOT a Conference or Team Competition - This would be an event that qualifies as a stand alone trip that is not a Conference or Team Competition and occurs more than once but at most six times. This could be several weekly visits to an elementary school for an enrichment program or a few hiking trips at different locations around the Tri-State area. NOTE: National Trips that are outside of the Tri-State Area can only be requested as a Singular Trip and not a Series. You may appeal for another National Trip if needed through the allocations appeals process each semester.Publication - These are media publications meant for distribution around campus or online.

As a group of history students, we will take a tour of the historic campsite and battleground allowing insight to a monumental era in American History. Rutgers students interested in History will get the chance to enrich their studies by visiting and learning from the site, onsite expert, and the museum. Such a trip would allow members to bond over their passion for history and contribute to a sense of community among Rutgers’ history lovers. We also want to connect our club and its members with professionals in the field of history, for RUSH is focused on promoting career development in this area (as we have successfully done in past trips, we will seek to arrange private Q&A sessions with such professionals to learn not just more in-depth history, but more about what it is like to work in Public History/Historical Preservation). On the significance and impact similar past RUSH trips have had on our members, RUSH members have contributed testimonials on their experiences. Here are some of them: From Gonzalo Sevillano: My participation in the Ellis Island trip greatly helped benefit me academically. I was taking a class called Intro to Immigration for my Sociology minor... While on the Ellis Island trip with RUSH I was able to gain better clarity of the concepts I learned in the class and how they were applied to the real world in this historical context. I ended up excelling in that class with an A and I believe the Ellis Island trip helped in that regard. Due to this I believe that RUSH trips are worthwhile opportunities as they can help history students apply the concepts they learned in their classes into the real world. Trisha Yu: RUSH trips are not simply fun experiences but give significant insight for students considering a career in history. I think a lot of students who are passionate about history hesitate to become history majors because they are unsure about their future careers. Going on trips with RUSH can give us opportunities to ask museum and tour guides questions that we otherwise may not have the chance to. I feel more comfortable asking a lot of questions to guides on trips when I am with RUSH, since I know that everyone is as interested in what is being talked about...For example, the most recent trip to Sleepy Hollow showed the importance of local historical agencies. I learned about what goes into preserving a historical site, and what the everyday work of a local historical agency volunteer is like. This motivated me even more to volunteer for a similar local agency in New Jersey, both to build my own resume and to contribute to a similar effort. I had similar positive experiences in last year’s trip to Washington DC. Being with a large group of history students visiting museums and other sites is more immersive and allows for more interesting conversations. Traveling with RUSH... gave me the chance to listen to other’s insights (such as learning how the flame on Kennedy’s grave operates and the painted ceiling of the Library of Congress). RUSH trips strengthen bonds between members, which ultimately helps history students' network with each other. RUSH is a more valuable student organization when it is able to show students the opportunities available to them in a variety of ways. While RUSH has also conducted virtual meetings with different people in the field of history, trips are significantly more immersive and give more opportunities for us to learn. Through trips, RUSH contributes to the next generation of historical educators by mixing engaging experiences with a lot of valuable information about educational and career paths. Member: I attended the Washington D.C. RUSH trip in the Spring 2024 semester, which was very well organized and executed by the E-Board. The club leaders, who are also members of the E-Board this year, were very responsible and prepared, having planned many relevant and educational activities for us. We went to many significant places in the area, one of which being the Library of Congress, which taught me a lot about those who had been a part of its creation, from the art on the walls to the collections in the library. I am super grateful that I was able to experience it, and I have since recommended it to many people as an incredible place to visit. We also went to a series of museums, one being the Museum of Natural History, a place I haven't had the chance to experience since I was in elementary school, so I was very excited. The E-Board clearly planned the trip with much thought, making sure that the money spent was used with the intention to allow for the best experience. Impactful trips such as this one is why I firmly believe that RUSH should have the ability to go on future trips with the necessary amount of funding, as it has shown to be an organization that wants its members to be able to fully experience history in a holistic manner. From Aaron Anchen: During the Spring 2025 semester, I and 11 other RUSH club members visited historic landmarks in Boston, Massachusetts. The trip was a riveting experience, allowing me to contextualize the role that Boston played in the American revolution and the city’s legacy for top-tier liberal arts education. The trip helped me bond with other members of RUSH over our passion for history as we shared common experiences such as long car rides, hotel rooms, historic sites, a college tour, and restaurants. I would highly recommend RUSH trips to anyone who is a history major, minor or just interested in history.",20,10/26/25,,150,Gas-- $120 (5 cars) + Tolls (5 cars) --$31 = $150,0,,400,$20 per person for trolley tour,300,$15 per person -- Coal Fired Pizza,0,,,,850,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,academic,,

With free Narcan Training opportunities, we help prepare Rutgers students to step up in a potentially life-saving manner in the event of an opioid overdose. Join us at our bi-weekly hybrid meetings to learn more about what opportunities are available to you. Check out our linktree for more information! PDAOA aims to promote awareness of the rising prevalence of prescription drug abuse and misuse to the Rutgers community with a specific focus on highly affected minority groups. The misuse of prescription medication in America has escalated in recent years to the point of being a public health crisis. Nearly 20,000 American die each year from opioid overdose each year with an estimated 2 million more having become addicted according to a national survey conducted by SAMHSA. Educating individuals and the community as a whole about the perils that the misuse of prescription drugs have is one of the most powerful tools that can contribute to the prevention of prescription drug abuse. PDAOA will conduct high school outreaches in order to educate the future generation about commonly abused prescription narcotics which can lead to addiction and overdose and the very real issue of overprescription and misprescription of prescription drugs. The term ""Primum non nocere"", meaning ""first, do no harm"" is the guiding bioethics principle that those in the healthcare field follow. Although doctors are well-intentioned and want to help their patients, the overprescription of medication is a serious problem with potentially fatal consequences that must be addressed.

Lastly, having a publication like this is a good keepsake to have to look back on the time spent in the club and the people that you met, and maybe one day there will be enough of these publications to create a small library of works from the Creative Writing Club.",Magazine,,,,,,,,,,1,30,600,0.2,120,3600,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,academic,no,Creative Writing Club

In 2014, there were less Black/African American men applying to medical school than in 1978, and the latest numbers indicate that Black/African American and Latino men represent only 2% and 3% respectively, of all medical school matriculants for the 2019-2020 application cycle (AAMC, 2020). The underrepresentation of minority men applying/matriculating to medical school will continue unless efforts are made at every level to address the problem. Research suggests that increasing physician diversity is associated with improving access to care for patients of low income, racial and ethnic minority groups, and non-English speaking patients, thus addressing the issue of health care disparities among these populations (Williams, Walker, & Egede, 2016). Although the number of Black/African American and Latino male college graduates have increased over the last 20 years, the number of applicants to medical schools have not kept pace (AAMC, 2016). Findings documented in the AAMC (2016) report indicate that underrepresented minority men have unique needs, and several critical factors have been identified for them to be successful medical school applicants/matriculants. These factors include knowledge of the career pathway, academic preparation ank/African American and Latino physician role models (AAMC, 2016; Thomas, et d socialization to the pre-med process, peer social support and the presence of Blacal, 2011). t would promote academic achievement to be a competitive medical school applicantThe Minority Men in Medicine organization at Rutgers University aims to:Provide resources to members that. Section 1a: There will be “Library Takeovers” (study sessions), which will be held once a week in the Library of Science and Medicine. This will allow the group members to share information and knowledge, and provide feedback regarding course work. Section 2a: Meetings will be held once every month and will consist of presentations on topics related to the pre-med journey, academic strategies for success, navigating the medical school application process, and information about the medical career pathway.Provide social support to assist members to overcome the challenges associated with being an underrepresented minority male pre-med student. Section 1b: Throughout the semester, there will be various opportunities for the members to have collective downtime designed to promote mental and physical health. “Check-ins” among members will be done on a regular basis to demonstrate community support for their well-being.Provide members with the opportunity to interact with physician role models in the medical community.

This program aims to engage children in various activities, provide an exciting end to their school week, and create a setting in which they feel safe and able to comfortable to engage with others. As stated in our mission statement, Pilot Me Mentoring is a community service-oriented organization that actively enriches the youth of the surrounding community of Rutgers University in New Brunswick. What makes Pilot Me unique is that it allows for personal one on one interaction between a college student and a child for an hour each week. Pilot Me Mentoring/Tutoring Program (Pilot Me) utilizes undergraduate students as volunteers and trains each undergraduate to mentor children throughout duration of the program each semester. Pilot Me is an established organization as a collaborative community service project between Rutgers University-New Brunswick and the New Brunswick Free Public Library. Pilot Me’s goals include: (1) creating a safe and educational environment for the children of New Brunswick, (2) creating and implementing programming that will benefit children and aide in their educational, social, and verbal development, (3) train Rutgers University undergraduates in Pilot Me to be effective mentors/tutors and to enhance undergraduate education by giving students meaningful life experiences, (4) to further integrate Rutgers University with the surrounding New Brunswick and Highland Park areas by community service projects. Pilot Me is an organization that actively integrates Rutgers University to its town of residence, New Brunswick. One of the University Mission statements states that the university must perform “public service in support of the needs of the citizens of the state” and Pilot Me serves as a tool of the university that allows it to be visible among its constituents, both within and outside the campus boundaries.",7,"10/03/2025, 10/10/2025, 10/24/2025, 10/31/2025, 11/14/2025, 11/21/2025, 12/05/2025",50,Untitled_document_(1).pdf,New Brunswick Public Library,0,,0,Multipurpose room at the New Brunswick Public Library,0,N/A,300,"The children begin each session with a snack and beverage.

Our mission is to support local blood centers by empowering, educating, and mobilizing the next generation of blood donors. We are a part of the National Organization known as ‘University Blood Initiative’’, which empowers local blood centers throughout the nation. We are a community of dynamic and passionate young leaders from across the nation. We work to support our local centers by informing and educating our communities. United we have the power to create a safer and more sustainable blood supply. Through our university chapter, we plan to raise awareness of having enough blood supply at Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Health, that goes locally to the patients in the hospital, so that no one has to worry about a shortage of blood during any kind of procedure. Even in the best of times, America’s blood supply is less than robust. The national supply often barely meets the demands for necessary surgeries, and difficulties in distribution can lead to outright shortages on a local level. Overall blood donation rates are low, and, to exacerbate the issue, the average blood donor is well into middle age. Our blood supply is facing a steep decline in the next few years, and young donors remain far too disengaged to prevent it. That’s where we come in. Especially during these hard times of a global pandemic, this is the least we can do to help our frontline workers. In a partnership with the local blood center at Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Health, we will be hosting blood drives along on and around campus. Students will have the opportunity to donate at the drives as well as encourage others to participate in this good cause. They will also be open to numerous volunteering opportunities and be able to acquire service hours for their contribution. We will be inviting speakers from the health care field as well as survivors for educational seminars and Q&A sessions that focus on the importance of blood donors and their need, especially among the youth. We aim to empower this generation, and hence we will be participating in educational campaigns in order to raise awareness. We will be reaching out to the general population outside of Rutgers, including high schools and community colleges and Rutgers students will have an opportunity to enhance their leadership and communication skills via the events. Interested students will have a chance to host and participate in presentations and seminars on various topics. We will be hosting fun fundraising events for the organization and RWJ Barnabas Health.

During this formal our main attraction will be a commonly known headliner who will perform cultural music and perform for the students. This allows students to experience art in a fun and enthusiastic space in which they can socialize in and meet other students as well.We will have a Punjabi DJ, who is trained in playing Punjabi/Hindi/American music to ensure all types of students are being catered to in terms of entertainment. He also MCs the dance floor ensuring a fun and interactive environment for the attendees.Food will be catered from Guru Palace, a North Indian Cuisine and Rutgers approved vendor. The full course menu will consist of appetizers, dinner, and dessert. The food items are carefully picked to ensure vegetarian and non vegetarian students are both catered to. Students get to enjoy food that tastes homemade and is different from their routine meals at Rutgers.Our decor will be done by a professional decorator to ensure the vision of Punjabi culture is captured in the most accurate manner. This setup will include draping by the entrance, backdrop for the ticketing area -set up right outside of the venue, photo-booth backdrop, along with props placed around the venue. This will all be done while adhering to student center policies as decorators we’ve worked with in the past and are knowledgeable about the rules and regulations as are we. The decor will consist of colorful fabrics, and traditional prop pieces to make the venue appear as a “real-life experience of being in Punjab”. The formal will consist of an array of dance and musical organizations from the Rutgers community. This will allow students, especially first year students, to see how inclusive Punjabi culture is, as well as the immense number of cultural groups on campus. In efforts to increase relationships with other organizations, we will be asking them to come out to our event and attend their events in return. The formal is designed for students to feel at home with their culture, and feel connected to their roots, which many students struggle to do in their everyday lives with their peers. Many students across Rutgers campus that are regular attendees of our formals come from lesser diverse schools previously and find comfort and acceptance in the formal.

The Chariot Festival, traditionally known as Ratha Yatra, is a joyful celebration that symbolizes the journey of the soul and the universal principle of togetherness. Originating in the ancient Vedic tradition, this festival commemorates the symbolic procession of the Divine through the streets—bringing spiritual energy, joy, and blessings to everyone, regardless of background or belief. At Origins, we are embracing this beautiful practice in a way that resonates with our Spiritual But Not Religious (SBNR) values. During our event, we will take two joyful rounds around Livingston Campus, pulling a decorated chariot while singing, dancing, and sharing spiritual insights. Just like the chariot that carries divine energy to every corner of the community, our club’s mission is to make spirituality accessible, universal, and rooted in reason. This festival perfectly aligns with our vision—to ignite curiosity, build community, and deepen inner resilience, all while transcending religious labels. The act of walking together, pulling the chariot, symbolizes the collective spiritual journey we’re all on—a journey of discovering purpose, inner peace, and joy. It’s not about a destination; it’s about moving forward with intention and connection. Come as you are—no rituals, no labels. Just a heart ready to explore.

At the Christmas Party, it will not only be a time of celebration with worship, food, and games, but the educational value of the night will be in the message shared by one of our leaders, chronicling the birth of Jesus as it significantly is.

Physical advertising for V.A.N.C.E. is done mainly through fliers in the form of color prints taped/stapled to bus stops and billboards. Rutgers printers charge $0.25 per color page. Each flier/Ad is 1 page (Color). Flyers get torn down, destroyed, or otherwise weathered, thus many of them are needed. From past experience 1000-2000 flyers is a good amount of ads to cover all of Rutgers throughout the Semester. We can average that out to 1500 - that makes for $375 in printing costs. Rutgers Students are only allotted $30 in terms of student funds to use for printing. Clearly this is not sufficient and the use of these funds cannot be considered. Tape and staples can be borrowed from our office supplies budget, so their costs are not listed here. Digital Advertising on Instagram and TikTok (our two main platforms) costs on average $3.5/1000 impressions. It takes around 5 impressions to generate a click, thus to effectively cover all 68,000 Rutgers students we will need around 340,000 impressions, which equates to $340. This needs to be done on both platforms as they are owned by separate companies, thus we need 680 for digital advertising. We consistently use SC Signage, but that is free of charge. Thus, the net cost is, at minimum, 1055.00.",2003,"V.A.N.C.E. uses catering for large Semester events. It usually has 2-3 such events per year (usually workshops or Voice Actor conferences). Thus this cost is meant to be spread across 3 events. These estimations are based on the catering costs of Gerlanda’s pizza, the most commonly used (and likely cheapest) catering option on campus. Most large pizzas cost between $18.25 for a cheese pizza, and $29 for some specialty pizzas, thus $23/pizza/event seems to be a reasonable average. For drinks, large sodas cost $3/ 20oz bottle. End of year V.A.N.C.E. events like workshops and VA conferences are pretty popular and can have >240 members present, assuming only 120-150 of them eat Pizza (reasonable by most metrics), at 1.5 slices per member and 2 servings of a drink that makes for 28 pizzas and 4 bottles of cola - $656 / event on average. Multiply this by 3 events and this becomes $1968. Disposable paper plates and utensils cost around $35 in total, adding up to ~$2003.",4457.54,"In order to maintain its community, V.A.N.C.E. has merch drops regularly to encourage members to keep checking up on the club even after Rutgers, which is a practice employed by many other clubs, particularly creatively minded clubs (this also has the potential of generating donations for the university). Most V.A.N.C.E. merchandise will come from Consolidus and will use Consolidus pricing. V.A.N.C.E. has 250+ Listed members, so assume, at a minimum, 300ish units of each merchandise item (this only presumes a ~80% purchase rate among members and about half of all graduating members to return back, which we have found to be reasonable given past data from other organizations). 300 Branded Pens (smallest amount available) is $288 (0.96 x 300). 1000 Round pins (1.25'') (as many as during the event fair) $300 (0.30 x 1000). 288 (closest amount) of the cheapest shirt with basic stylization $1,108.80 (3.83 x 288). In terms of Merchandise, this is bare bones, since it's just pins, buttons, and shirts (all at the cheapest price). Together it's $1,698.80. Allow for a 15% - 20% cushion for customization, equates to slightly more than $2,000 (2,038.56).Custom Plushies of Mikey/Forte (the two V.A.N.C.E. mascots representing a Mixer and a Microphone, respectively) are highly requested by the club internally. A bulk order is thus preferred, meaning at least 50 of each plushie.Since Consolidus does not make plushies this will need to be contracted externally, the cheapest manufacturer that we could find had a price of $359.99 for initial designs followed by $10+ 6.47 shipping/plushie, which for 2 designs and 100 plushies, total to 2418.98. The Plushies are distributed freely as part of the technical education that V.A.N.C.E. plans to provide to aspiring Audio engineers. Hence why there are less of them then there are members.

Beginning at 4:00 PM, the showcase will feature a dynamic lineup of performances, with dancers wearing traditional attire representing their respective regions. The performances will include starring movement from South Africa, legwork from Nigeria, and a fusion of styles such as Azonto from Ghana, Ndombolo from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Coupé-Décalé from Côte d'Ivoire.

Prince will deliver an insightful talk on Africa’s role as the blueprint for many dance styles around the world, exploring how traditional African movement has influenced hip-hop, salsa, jazz, and even ballet. He will discuss the global impact of African rhythms and movement, highlighting how African dance techniques have shaped contemporary styles and continue to influence music and choreography today.

These natural highs may include hobbies, interests, or people an individual cares about. In short, our organization views encouraging students to pursue their passion as a method of prevention.

Because of our predicted increase in membership, we request $2,500 for crewneck purchases.Our merchandise will prominently feature both “MedicZero” and “Rutgers,” reinforcing the shared commitment of our organization and the university to life-saving interventions and advancements in pre-hospital care. By successfully distributing branded merchandise, MedicZero Rutgers can increase visibility across campus, fostering greater awareness of our mission.

This initiative aims to raise awareness about medical emergencies while enhancing bystander education to encourage timely intervention and improve prehospital care.Our overarching goal is to create a safer and more prepared environment at Rutgers and in the surrounding communities by equipping individuals with the knowledge and confidence to respond effectively in emergency situations.,6,"09/18/2025, 09/25/2025, 10/02/2025, 10/16/2025, 11/06/2025, 11/20/2025",360,MZR_RU_24-25_CT_training_report_-_Sheet1.pdf,"All CPR Trainings will be at The Hatchery in Archibald S. Alexander Library for all weekly meetings, Rutgers Classrooms for stroke presentations (specific location depends on the professor and class), and Student Centers for walk-by tabling training events.",N/A,,0,,0,,1450,"To enhance engagement and participation in our CPR Training sessions, MedicZero Rutgers aims to provide food at these events. However, given our current programming budget, this is not currently feasible. To support this initiative, we require $1,050 to fund six training sessions at the Hatchery, each of which will include 10 pizza pies from Gerlanda’s at a cost of $17.50 per pie. Providing food at CPR Training sessions has been shown to significantly increase attendance, allowing more members to engage with our mission of advancing bystander education and improving prehospital care. Retaining active members strengthens our ability to teach life-saving skills to a broader audience. Also, our trainers volunteer their time to train others. We would like to provide food to express our appreciation to them for taking the time and joining us to learn lifesaving skillsAdditionally, offering candy and chocolate as incentives at tabling events has proven effective in attracting students to learn a new life-saving skill. This strategy also enhances recruitment efforts and increases participation in our Train-The-Trainer (TTT) program, ultimately expanding the number of trainers available for presentations and tabling events across Rutgers. Based on expenditure data from previous semesters, the cost of such incentives is estimated at approximately $400 per semester. Investing in these engagement efforts will enable us to maximize our impact on campus by promoting bystander intervention and strengthening the prehospital response landscape.",2340.9,"Many of our bystander CPR training sessions follow a walk-by format, where we engage with the public in open spaces, attracting individuals to learn hands-only CPR and other life-saving interventions. To effectively capture attention and communicate our mission, we require high-quality, custom-printed posters. These posters not only serve as visual anchors to draw in participants but also provide a concise overview of our organization’s purpose and initiatives. Each custom poster costs approximately $100. To ensure visibility across various activities, we purchase 4 posters total: one for our meeting space during training sessions, one for tabling events on campus, and two for concurrent training sessions held at different locations (summing $400 for posters). Finally, we will need to purchase new equipment to sustain our growing training initiatives. ‘Little Family QCPR’ manikins from Laerdal include an adult, a child, and an infant, which models bystander skills across age groups. This is priced at $849.000 pre-tax. We also need to purchase trainer AEDs for $291.90 ($145.95 each), which help simulate real-life emergency scenarios and improve hands-on proficiency and confidence. Investing in high-quality training equipment is essential for ensuring that our CPR training remains effective, professional, and aligned with current standards (this totals to $1140.90 for equipment). The majority of our training equipment is battery-powered, which allows us to receive feedback on the quality of compressions as well as simulate the functionality of the non-trainer counterparts. In the past, we have spent $50 dollars on batteries of various types to accommodate our diverse equipment needs.Additionally, MedicZero Rutgers requires $750 to provide uniform training shirts for our growing team of trainers. Each shirt costs approximately $25, and with an expected increase of 30 new trainers, we aim to ensure all members are properly outfitted. These shirts contribute to a professional and cohesive presence at tabling events and training sessions, reinforcing our credibility and commitment to prehospital education. In total, we seek $2,340.90 to fund all of our equipment (posters, training equipment uniforms). This equipment will be essential towards MedicZero’s continued ability to make a meaningful impact across Rutgers by promoting life-saving education and enhancing community preparedness.",1800,,,Other,,,,,"Raghav Mahajan - AHA CPR Instructor: $1800Each semester, MedicZero Rutgers sponsors CPR certifications for members interested in our TTT program, which requires a CPR certification.

A great deal of attention is given to cancer and cardiovascular disease as they both are not only predominant in our country-as they are the leading causes of death in the US- but both feature visible symptoms to the condition as well as the agonizing pain the patient is endures. The latter, neurodegenerative diseases, shows very few, if any, outward symptoms or signs of pain thereby drawing less attention. Although there are very few physical cues of neurodegenerative and neurological diseases, they are life-altering and often terminal. However, it does not stop at neurodegenerative diseases, there are several categories of virulent diseases and disorders that affect the nervous system, including but not limited to: neurobehavioral disorders, neuroinfectious diseases, neurovascular disorders, neurological trauma, neuro-oncologic diseases, and neuroimmune diseases. Many of these categories of diseases are widely unknown to the general public, which serves as a community health issue as individuals with such complications do not seek medical attention in the early, critical stages of the disease/disorder.

Students will understand how to conduct user research, create compelling visual designs, and develop a working prototype. They will be introduced to different roles within design, case studies, learning about human-centered design thinking, ethical, accessible, and inclusive design, and the overall processes. iii. The Product Engineering track is meant to teach students the fundamentals of bringing a product to life, from simply an idea to a fully functional product. Fellows will learn standard web development tactics, Git, and how to build a portfolio & gain experience. Members of the track will learn in a beginner-friendly environment. iv.

With the momentum from last year, we anticipate an even larger turnout this year, expanding both the number of teams and attendees to an estimated 150 people.
